INTRODUCTION                                       *easydir*

Using easydir is quite easy. Functionality remains the same for editing and
saving files, but now you can prepend nonexistent directories to the desired
file name to create them.

EXAMPLES

:e new_directory/new_file.txt      Edits a file called |new_file.txt|
                                   which is nested inside |new_directory/|

:w new_directory/new_file2.txt     Writes the file as |new_file2.txt| and
                                   creates the directory |new_directory/|

:w new_dir/another_dir/file.txt    You can even nest multiple directories!

That's it! So *easy!*
